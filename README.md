# Brain-stroke-prediction
This repository contains code for a brain stroke prediction model that uses machine learning to analyze patient data and predict stroke risk. It was trained on patient information including demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. The model has been deployed on a website where users can input their own data and receive a prediction.
